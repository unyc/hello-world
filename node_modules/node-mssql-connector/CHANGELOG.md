	...
	```
- Allow setting variables with underscore, e.g.

	```
	query = MSSQLClient.query( "
			SELECT * 
			FROM Table
			WHERE id = @last_id
	" )
	query.param( "last_id", "Int",  23 )
	...
	```

- Add IN statement in one param. 
- Run on nodejs v0.10.25


`v0.2.0`

- Change the complete error handling. Errors will now always be returned as an object in the callback method:
	
	```
	// Example of an error whcih happens when there will be more params set than in query 
	query = MSSQLClient.query( "
			SELECT * 
			FROM Table
			WHERE id = @id
	" )
	query.param( "id", "Int",  100 )
	query.param( "otherfield", "Int",  200 )
	query.exec( function( err, res ){
		console.log( err );
		
		/*
			Result
						
			{ 
				name: 'param-not-found',
  				message: 'Param 'otherfield' was not found in query or is tried to set twice' 
  			}	
  				
		*/
	});
	```
	This is already implemented into the tests.
